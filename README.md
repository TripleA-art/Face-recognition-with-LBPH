# Face-recognition-with-LBPH
This is the face recognition system with Local Binary Pattern Histogram(LBPH).


## Project Set up and Installation

Firstly, for this project,opencv and numpy must be installed.


##Dataset

I used my created own dataset with four different folders for different people that are used
for the training process.


## Script Files used
1.`face_train.py` is for the model `trainner.yml`.
2.`face_detection.py` is for the output file to text the model `trainner.yml` and web cam
is used for the test set.


## Results
Face recognition with LBPH is a first step for face recognition.Although the recognition
outputs are not good enough,may be because of my dataset. More samples will get more accurate
results.
